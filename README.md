## About This App

This is my solution to The Odin Project's JavaScript Tic-Tac-Toe assignment. The task was to create a browser-playable game of tic-tac-toe using object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript.

## How to Play the Game

**Note:** To see the game in action, watch the demo video at the top of this README.

### Step 1: Fill Out Your Player Name Information (Optional) and Hit Start Game

Each player can optionally set their name using the controls below the board. These inputs (and the Start Game button) are styled so they light up to indicate which field is currently active.

If you hit "Start Game" without setting a name for each player, the app will just set each player's name to "Player 1" or "Player 2" depending on their order.

### Step 2: Begin Playing

When you hit "Start Game," the board's cells will activate. A click will result in the current player's marker ("X" or "O") being placed in that cell. If the cell already contains a move, nothing will happen.

As you play, text under the board will update to let users know who the current player is.

### Step 3: Restart the Game After a Win or Tie

When the game is over (due to either a win or tie), you can restart it by clicking the "Restart" button in the controls section.

If the game ends due to a win, the winning path will be highlighted and the board will become non-interactive.
